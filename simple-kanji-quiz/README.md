Simple Kanji Quiz
=================

This is a backup of the assets from an android app I used to use back in....
2010? Maybe? I don't quite remember, what I know is that the app has long been
removed from app store and I'm kinda worried now that I will sometime down the
line lose access to the resources from that app, so I'm making this backup that
I will probably just end up throwing into Anki and get rid of the original app
for good, which is kinda sad, because it's a great app in my option, but
whatever. :smile:
